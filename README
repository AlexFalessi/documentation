Version 0.3

=Changes=
Added a file (doc_macros.xml)  containing  target macros. Replaced
the contents of doc.xml with a generic installation file which needs
to be edited when creating a new manual (see INSTALL).
Java XML validation (Validate class) was replaced  with ant XML 
validation. For this  ant-nodeps.jar was added in the lib folder and the
Validate class was removed from doc-utils.jar.  The validation now shows
the file with the error (line, column) instead of a line and column in
tmp/main.xml. Also, the build stops if the XML file is invalid.

Version 0.2
=Changes=

Ant targets added
 clean              Deletes the generated files
 compile.doc.utils  Compile Documentation Utils
 jar.doc.utils      Builds a jar containing the documentation java helper classes
 toolchain          Builds and copies the toolchain in ./built                   

The DocBook folder has been removed and replaced with a zip archive containing the files.
The java class files are now supplied as  lib/doc-utils.jar instead being built when building
the documentation. The "src" folder (java files) has been removed from the built toolchain as
is now longer necessary.
