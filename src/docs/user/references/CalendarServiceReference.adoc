=== Calendar Service
Calendar service is another ProActive micro-service allowing to visualize and manage (edit and delete) all jobs and planned jobs created by the user in a calendar client application having CalDav support such as Outlook, Thunderbird Lightning, Mac Calendar, Google Calendar, etc. 

=== Subscribe to Calendar Service

To use Calendar Service, it's simple to subscribe to the calendar service url from within a calendar client application. 

==== Calendar service URL

The Calendar service's URL is in the following format

[source]
----
http://*host-address*:5232/*user*/private-*unique-code*.ics/
----

* `host-address` - ProActive server address
* `user` - ProActive scheduler user login name
* 'unique-code' - A unique hashing value

ProActive user can get this URL from scheduler portal's `Calendar` button

ProActive user can create a unique private URL by clicking on the `Create` button in the popup window.

The generated private URL can then be used in a calendar client application to receive jobs events coming from ProActive Scheduler. The user's private URL can be regenerated, or deleted and recreate if it is compromised.
