=== Overview

The <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>> allows users to subscribe, be notified and react when different
types of events occur during <<_glossary_job,*Job*>> execution, on the state of the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler,*ProActive Scheduler*>> or when
automating and scheduling jobs with the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>>.

=== Subscriptions

==== Principle

In order to be notified of events a user must have an active <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>> with an associated active notification method.
It is possible to be notified via the <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>>, email
or <<_glossary_notification_third_party,*Third party*>> which is the execution of a script provided by the user.

All these notification methods can be used simultaneously in the same <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>>.

==== Subscription types

There are three types of <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscriptions*>>:

- Scheduler subscription: To be notified when the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler ,*Scheduler*>> changes its state
- Job planner subscription: Currently this subscription can be activated with only one event type "All events"
that corresponds to different issues the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>> may encounter.
Check out the <<_job_planner_notifications,Job Planner Notifications>> to look at the full list of events.
- Job subscriptions: To be notified of events that may occur during <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> executions.

By default each user has a Scheduler and a Job Planner subscription. To start receiving notifications it is ony required
to choose notification methods, event types and activate the <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>>.

On the other hand Job subscriptions have to be created in order to receive notifications.
To create a job subscription, go to the <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>>,
job subscriptions tab and click on the _+_ button

image::job-subscription-creation-button.png[align="center"]

Then fill and select the mandatory fields and click on _Save_

image::job-subscription-creation.png[align="center"]

At least one of the fields of <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> data must be provided to create the subscription, that means it
is not possible to create a job subscription that will listen for all jobs submitted to the Scheduler.

Two scenarios are possible:

- If is provided only a bucket name, then the user will be notified for all <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflows*>> of the bucket
- Otherwise there has to be an exact match between the bucket name, project name and workflow name of the subscription
and the bucket name, project name, workflow name of the workflow you wish to be notified of.

The process is the same for Scheduler and Job_planner subscriptions without the
need to provide <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> data. Select notification methods,
events and create the <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>>.

To modify a subscription simply click on it and do your adjustments.

==== Notification methods

The user must activate at least one notification method to be able to activate a subscription. It defines how the user is notified .
There are three notification methods available.

- "Portal": The notification will be displayed in the <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>>
- "Email": The notification will be sent by email.
- "Third-party": To trigger a script execution, please refer to link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_notification_third_party[Third paty] for more details
