=== Overview

The <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>> allows users to subscribe, be notified and react when different
types of events occur during <<_glossary_job,*Job*>> execution, on the state of the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler,*ProActive Scheduler*>> or when
automating and scheduling jobs with the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>>.

=== Subscriptions

==== Principle

A notification <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>> consists in a set of events selected by a user for a particular service,
a type of workflows or a specific workflow.

Event reception is configurable and allows portal notifications, email sending and custom script execution.

A user creating a subscription will need to:

- Select one of the subscription types
- Select one or more events from a predefined list that user will be notified of.
- Activate one or more notification methods.

==== Subscription types

There are two types of <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscriptions*>>:

- Service subscriptions such as the Scheduler subscription to be notified when the <<_glossary_proactive_scheduler ,*Scheduler*>> changes its state
or the Job planner subscription which can be activated with only one event type "All events"
that corresponds to different issues the <<_glossary_job_planner,*Job Planner*>> may encounter.
Check out the <<_job_planner_notifications,Job Planner Notifications>> to look at the full list of events.
- Job subscriptions: To be notified of events that may occur during <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> executions.

Service subscriptions are unique for each service. They can be enabled or disabled for each particular service.

Job Subscriptions can be multiple, one can create various subscriptions for various kind of workflow types.

By default each user has a Scheduler and a Job Planner subscription.
To start receiving notifications, users only needs to choose notification methods,
event types and activate the <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>>.

On the other hand, Job subscriptions must be defined and created to receive Job notifications.
To create a job subscription, go to the <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>>,
job subscriptions tab and click on the _+_ button

Then fill and select the mandatory fields and click on _Save_

image::job-subscription-creation.png[align="center"]

At least one field of <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> data must be provided to create the subscription, that means it
is not possible to create a job subscription that will listen for all jobs submitted to the Scheduler.

Two scenarios are possible:

- If a bucket name is only set, then the user will be notified for all <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflows*>> of the bucket
- Otherwise, the bucket name, project name and workflow name of the workflow you wish to be notified of
must exactly match with the bucket name, project name and workflow name of the subscription.

The process is the same for Scheduler and Job_planner subscriptions without the
need to provide <<_glossary_workflow,*Workflow*>> data. Select notification methods,
events and create the <<_glossary_notification_subscription,*Subscription*>>.

To modify a subscription simply click on it and do your adjustments.

==== Notification methods

To define the way to be notified, the user must activate at least one notification method.
It is mandatory to activate at least one to be able to activate a subscription.

There are three notification methods available

- "Portal": The notification will be displayed in the <<_glossary_notification_portal,*Notification Portal*>>.

- "Email": The notification will be sent by email using SMTP protocol hence SMTP server related data
needs to be provided in order for the notification service to connect to the server and use it.
Go to the link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_email_notification_method[Email notification method]
section in the Admin guide to look at configuration.

- "Third-party": To trigger a script execution. It also requires configuration to specify the location of the script,
or optional options such as multiple script execution.
Go to the link:../admin/ProActiveAdminGuide.html#_third_party_notification_method[Third party notification method]
section in the Admin guide to look at the full configuration.
