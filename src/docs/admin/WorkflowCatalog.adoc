The Workflow Catalog stores ProActive workflows through a REST API.
It is subdivided into buckets.
Each bucket has a unique name and store zero, one or more versioned ProActive workflows.

By default, ProActive workflows are persisted on disk using the embedded HSQL database.
The data is located in _PROACTIVE_HOME/data/db/workflow-catalog_.

The Workflow Catalog is a WAR file which contains a configuration file.
More information can be found in <<_workflow_catalog_properties>>.
