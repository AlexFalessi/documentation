The Workflow Catalog stores ProActive workflows through a REST API.
It is subdivided into buckets.
Each bucket has a unique name and stores zero, one or more versioned ProActive workflows.

By default, ProActive workflows are persisted on disk using the embedded HSQL database.
The data is located in `PROACTIVE_HOME/data/db/workflow-catalog`.

The Workflow Catalog is a WAR file which contains a configuration file.
More information regarding the Workflow Catalog configuration can be found in <<_workflow_catalog_properties>>.



A complete documentation of the Workflow Catalog REST API is available by default on:

  http://localhost:8080/workflow-catalog

This documentation is automatically generated using http://swagger.io[Swagger^].
