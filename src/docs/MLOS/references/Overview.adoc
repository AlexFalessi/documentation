*Machine Learning Open Studio (MLOS)* is an interactive graphical interface that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. It provides a rich set of generic machine learning tasks that can be connected together to build basic and complex machine learning workflows for various use cases such as: fraud detection, text analysis, online offer recommendations, prediction of equipment failures, facial expression analysis, etc. These tasks are open source and can be easily customized according to your needs. ML-OS can schedule and orchestrate executions while optimising the use of computational resources. Usage of resources (e.g. CPU, GPU, local, remote nodes) can be quickly monitored.
